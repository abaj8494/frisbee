a violation, and not a foul.

17.4. Blocking Fouls:
17.4.1. A Blocking Foul occurs when a player takes a position that an opponent moving in a legal manner will be unable to avoid, taking into account the opponents expected position based on their established speed and direction, and non-minor contact results. This is to be treated as either a receiving foul or an indirect foul, whichever is applicable.

17.5. Force-out Fouls:
17.5.1. A Force-out Foul occurs when a receiver is in the process of establishing possession of the disc, and is fouled by a defensive player before establishing possession, and the contact caused the receiver:
17.5.1.1. to become out-of-bounds instead of in-bounds; or
17.5.1.2. to catch the disc in the central zone instead of their attacking end zone.
17.5.2. If the receiver would have caught the disc in their attacking end zone, it is a goal;

contact resulting from the thrower and the defender both vying for the same unoccupied
position, prior to the release.
17.6.1.3. If a Defensive Throwing Foul occurs prior to the thrower releasing the disc and not
during the throwing motion, the thrower may choose to call a contact infraction, by
calling “Contact”. After a contact infraction that is not contested, play does not stop and
the marker must resume the stall count at one (1).

17.7. Offensive Throwing (Thrower) Fouls:
17.7.1. An Offensive Throwing Foul occurs when the thrower is solely responsible for initiating nonminor contact with a defensive player who is in a legal position.

should be avoided.

player that does not directly affect an attempt to make a play on the disc.

foul.

offsetting fouls, and the disc must be returned to the last non-disputed thrower.

involved can no longer make a play on the disc, this must be treated as an Indirect Foul
(excluding contact related to Section 17.1).
